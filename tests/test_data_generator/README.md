## Generate Test Data for Scorecard

The code in this directory is to generate output data that is used to test scorecard code. This only needs to be run
when the output data changes, since the results are checked in.

### Running

```
cd tests/test_data_genertor
./scorecard_generator.sh
```
The above should change the files in test/test_data.
